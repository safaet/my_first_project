        <h2 id="rabbits-info-heading">Why rabbits make great pets</h2>

        <p>Rabbits are little creatures with long ears and puffy tails, and they move their nose up and down in an adorable way. They eat the most orange vegetables in <em>our</em> world, and <strong>they reproduce more than any human ever has.</strong></p>

        <p class="song-lyrics">Little Bunny Foo Foo, <br>
            I don't want to see you <br>
            scooping up the field mice <br>
            and bopping them on the head!</p>
        <p class="song-lyrics">
            And down came the Good Fairy <br>
            And she said <br>
            "Little bunny Foo Foo <br>
            I don't like you' re attitude <br>
            Scopping up the field mice <br>
            And bopping 'em on the head" <br>
        </p>

        <p>I'll give you 3 chances. <br>

        The next day...
